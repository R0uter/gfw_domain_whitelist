## How to use 

Download the [`whitelist.pac`](https://R0uter.github.io/gfw_domain_whitelist/), edit the server IP and the type of proxy. After that change your browser's config, point to `whitelist.pac`.

	var proxy = new Array( "SOCKS5 127.0.0.1:1080; SOCKS 127.0.0.1:1080;",
	Change the type of proxy,it also can be 'HTTPS'
    Make sure to change both SOCKS5 and SOCKS


### Use script to generate the PAC file

Excute command `python3 main.py`, `whitelist.pac` will updated. 


### Load-Balance

You can change `okToLoadBalance` value to `true` to use the load balance feature, when you edit `whitelist.pac` you will found three proxy config in there. Only first config will become effective if you leave `okToLoadBalance` maintain `false`, but if you want to use load balance, you need edit all proxy row as well.

    "SOCKS5 127.0.0.1:1083; SOCKS 127.0.0.1:1083;",
    Different port or ip, and do not lose the comma!
    

As you see, `proxy` is an array, you can add at most ten proxies to load balance! Though three is good enough.

There is one more thing you should know that load-balancing is domain-based load balance, so it would not accelorate video or download something. Do not use this feature if your proxies not speed same.
